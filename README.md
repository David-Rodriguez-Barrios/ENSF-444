# ENSF-444
This repository showcases different machine learning system examples utilizing different supervised learning models.
## Assignment 2
This folder showcases the utilization of a classification model built by a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam and not spam. The model classifies emails as spam or not spam depending on the word frequencies. Data features are processed and split from Pandas and Numpy to train and then validate the metrics of the model afterwards. In the second part, a regression model utilizing linear models: linear regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression to predict the compressive strength of concrete given different features such as the concrete's slag, ash, water, coarseness, age, fine, and cement.

## Assignment 3
This folder creates regression models utilizing decision trees and model ensembles such as random forests and gradient boosting to predict the compression strength of cement depending on the features specified above. The second part of this file, demonstrates classification utilizing an SVC, Linear SVC, and a decision tree classifier. Here we are classifying a wine based on a feature matrix about its tocopherols, alcohol, malic acid, ash, alkalinity of ash, magnesium, Flavanoids, non-flavanoids phenols, Proanthocyanins, color intensity, and hue.
