This meant the model had a fairly good relationship with our model with regards to not overfitting, however, it had a very large MSE in both datasets.\n",
        " In comparison, in this lab our R2 for decision trees was 0.8228872809524459 for training and 0.1762104452178903 for testing. For random forest it was R2 Score 0.881221342371458 for training and 0.1737480262274312 for testing. For gradient boosting the training R2 score was 0.9864362663137645 and the testing R2 score was 0.4737008698990578. The MSE accuracies were as follows for decision trees the training accuracy was 47.918561 and had a validation accuracy of 163.087775. The Random forrest had a training accuracy MSE of 32.055432 and a validation accuracy MSE of 156.404972. The gradient boosting had a training accuracy MSE and validation accuracy MSE of 3.73927 and 99.360259 respectively. In these lab results the higher training R2 score and low validation R2 score may signify that there is overfitting from the training. This is supported further by the larger MSE in the validation datasets in comparison to the training datasets. The previous lab's had lower training R2 score but it was closer to the validation R2 Score of approximately 0.609 and 0.636. This model was less overfit and had comparable MSE performance in the validation dataset compared to this lab's model which had very low training MSE but very high validation MSE. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Out of the models you tested, which model would you select for this dataset and why?\n",
        "Out of the models tested in this lab, the gradient boosted model fits better for this dataset in my opinion since it has an R2-score that is 0.4737008698990578 on the validation dataset and the training R2-score was very high at 0.9864362663137645. This may signify over-fitting from the dataset however, it had the best performance in the validation dataset. The closer the R2-score is to 1 the better fit the model is for the datasets thus in my opinion it is still not optimal however, since the validation R2 score is still very low however, it is better than the other models created in this assignment. Additionally, the MSE accuracies between the decision tree, the random forest, and the gradient boosting showed that the gradient boosting had a lower MSE accuracy than the other models in both training and testing. This suggests that is a better model since it had a lower MSE accuracy. That being said, if we include the previous assignments models. This assignments' models are better since they have lower MSE accuracies in general. The lower R2 score may suggest slight overfitting.\n",
        "## If you wanted to increase the accuracy of the tree-based models, what would you do? Provide two suggestions.\n",
        "If I wanted to increase the accuracy of the tree based models I would increase the depth of the trees to enable more thorough feature classification. This would potentially lead to overfitting however, it would ensure a higher MSE accuracy in the training dataset. Additionally, it may potentially improve the accuracy for the testing until it reaches a certain depth level where it overfits. \n",
        "\n",
        "We could also try having an ensemble of decision trees which would lead to mitigated biases within the different models by weighting them out to mitigate biases and mitigating over and underfitting in these models. The different models could have different feature importance and thus lead to different predictions on top of having different depth levels. "
